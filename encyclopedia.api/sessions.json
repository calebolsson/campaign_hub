                    "description": "Torgrave gathered a group of adventurous fellows to fight back against the invasion of deadly arcane constructs. While gathering resources, the party came across some invader sympathizers and slaughtered them. They stole their plans and intercepted a supply drop, AND they killed the entourage, stealing the strange vehicle for their own. The vehicle was covered in arcane runes similar to the symbols they found on a smaller hand-cannon device. The party spent some time attempting to decipher the runes, but were unable to at first."

On their way north, they ran in to the 51st warforged battalion 'Ravenguard' but soon after their paths diverged once more. In a small town they came to, they met Dhin, a defector from a mysterious Order who had tasked himself with protecting the last egg of the ancient golden dragon Judah. After encounters with Blackfist, some bears, and a cyborg bounty hunter, the party uncovered clues and solved puzzles that led them ever closer to Judah's fabled Dragon's Hoard."

                    "description": "The party entered the cave they had been led to, and quickly encountered a group of Piercers. Through brilliant teamwork they were able to defeat a terrifying Roper without suffering any casualties. Upon further exploration of the cave, it became evident that it used to house a population of dragon-worshipping individuals. The party came across some items left behind by these peoples, and were forced to fight a skeletal minotaur guard. The party explored further, and found the place to hatch the dragon. It was a beautiful moment, and Haagen started bonding with the baby while the others went deeper into the cave. They found an Aboleth, which taunted them while offering the secret truths to finding their hearts desires, should they be willing to sacrifice something in return."

                    "description": "After briefly debating over whether or not to sacrifice Dhin to the aboleth, the party finished looting the cave. Archibald had a druidic vision at a shrine to an ancient dragon slaying warrior, Chong copied down the rest of the draconic art at the dragon hatching shrine, Nafaryus and Torgrave read some books and spoke with their patrons, Visok started having flashbacks to 'Nam his rough barbarian past, and Haagen started raising baby Draco. After leaving the cave and heading north, they dropped off Dhin at a town, but also picked up Kanaan and Ezra, the hunted Runen. When the party got to the northern shore of La'Dafri, they met Lord Raven and held back a large invading force with the help of the Ravenguard. Torgrave's divine smite and Nafaryus' 'Hand Cannon'â„¢ killed off a massive titan construct, and the rest of the party teamed up to defeat a clockwork dragon."

                    "description": "The party clashed with Lord Raven before deciding they would venture into the northern lands to impress Sir Claudius. Visok's nightmares began to subside, Haagen nurtured Draco into his youth, Nafaryus studied the tomes from the draconic library, Torgrave meditated with the Runen, and Chong kept his journals up to date. When they arrived on the far shore, they met Ras the Ecstatic who answered their questions about the invasion and some draconic history. The party learned about Mordred the dragon slayer, and suspect Raven to be somehow connected to him. They trained their friend Draco, who was growing very quickly. Ras told them he thinks the invaders are coming from the northern mountains, so the party headed in that direction. They came across an abomination that nearly killed Archibald, but Chong saved the day by dispelling the magics that had put together the amalgamation. Otherworldly magics frightened the party away from the dark tree, and they continued on their journey northward."

                    "description": "After escaping a mysterious memory-erasing creature (that the party named 'Slender-vort') they discovered the mountain pass in the north was guarded by an elf named Uragiri. He informed the party that he serves the Imperator, a leader from another plane who mounted the invasion against our world. The party met and fought Smertel, a part-construct monstrosity who commands the warforged invaders. They escaped just as reinforcements arrived to back up the fleeing Smertel. The party decided to drive the Killdozer up the mountain further west from the village, and when they reached the top they caught a glimpse of the armies of the Imperator."

                    "description": "Lord Raven and the Ravenguard surprise attacked Uragiri's fort, and the party intentionally caused an avalanche that destroyed the fort. With the avalanche serving as an adequate distraction, the party made their way incognito through the enemy camp and up to the portal. On the other side they discovered a world filled with arcane metal men. A small group of survivors explained that these metal men took over and committed genocide against the 'fleshborn', and that the party was at risk by being there. Joining the party in the killdozer, the survivors spoke with the party and helped them realize that their worlds aren't very different from one anothers, and the party began to wonder if they were in a different plane or if they had traveled through time. To prove their theory they drove to the draconic shrine in La'Dafri, but it was nowhere to be found. Instead they found a strange shrine to eleven unknown heroes. The party accidentally gets into a fight with a purple worm, which they used as their ticket home. Chong polymorphed the worm into a bunny and then rushed it to the city where they let it loose while they ran to the portal. The Imperitor arrived to slay the beast, and the party escaped onto the cold mountain in their home plane. Nafaryus's patron opened a smaller portal out of nowhere, saving the party from being discovered by the armies of metal men."

                    "description": "Claudius revealed his identity as both Torgrave's mentor and Nafaryus' patron. He also revealed that he was responsible for inviting the Imperitor's armies to the plane, as he felt it could protect them against a common enemy. The party was baffled by his involvement, but trusts him enough to follow his instructions to spend time in training before attempting to face the Imperitor. They presumed that the strange and evil encounters they had recently were part of the common enemy that Claudius warned them about. The party traveled south to the Badlands, and there met an ancient dragon they named 'Bill'. He helped them fight off a shadowy swordsman and it's large grotesque draconic mount who had been eating the sheep of a nearby town. Bill became friends with the party, who spent a number of months in training. The party reunited after this period of training, bringing back new skills and new items to help their cause."

                    "description": "Bill learned more about the party in that time, and wanted to help them achieve some of their personal quests and goals. He told the party he would go and look for abandoned dragon hoards, but the party wanted to help so he sent them to check out the nearest one while he scouted further away. Bringing Draco along, the party discovered a camp of pirates who were using an old dragon's den as a hideout. They left Draco outside and entered the den, attempting to make friends with the pirates. It all went south when the pirates revealed they had captured Draco. Haagen slaughtered a group of pirates to prove a point, after which the pirates released Draco and fled. The party returned to the village they had been staying at to find it burned to the ground. Despite originally thinking it was the pirates, they discovered that it was a paradoxical yet formidable dragonborn dragon slayer bearing an axe similar in craftmanship to Lord Raven's blade. He challenged Haagen, and by extension the party, to fight. The party contemplated running away, but ultimately sent Draco to safety while they prepared to fight."

                    "description": "The dragon slayer produced a number of draconic minions who flew around and launched slag at the party. He eventually turned a number of those minions into armored wings for himself, which he used to gain the upper hand and nearly kill Haagen. Draco arrived just in time to rescue his best friend, and brought Bill along with him. The dragonslayer declared in pleasure that he would slay the last dragon, but Bill proved him wrong and transformed into his true gargantuan form. Haagen banished the dragonslayer for just long enough for the party to regroup and for Nafaryus to summon a few undead to aide them. They were able to slay the dragonslayer, but not before he killed Bill. Visok claimed the axe for himself, and Torgrave deliberated trading out his white armor for the black armor in honor of Bill."
